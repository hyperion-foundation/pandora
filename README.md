# Pandora
Pandora is a simple administrative bot to organize your server.
### FAQ
- Can I run Pandora with my own server?
For now, Pandora is under heavy development and there is no source code available. If Pandora successfully running without any bugs, we will push the source code to this repo and you can host Pandora on your server for free.
### Features (Coming Soon)
1. Moderation system (Suspend/Mute, Kick & Ban user).
2. Ranking system.
3. Scanning bad text messages (Bad words, bad-links, excessive emojis, etc).
4. Logging system.
